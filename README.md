For project 2 we took in two data sources from kaggle. The first was a series of data about real estate prices in the United States, the second was self reported salary data from employed data scientists. The first was found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedshahriarsakib/usa-real-estate-dataset?resource=download and the second was found here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ruchi798/data-science-job-salaries. This information was downloaded as csv's (see the data folder in this repository). The data was formatted by filtering the unnessecary columns and further paring down this data to include only local (PA only) house prices and only factoring in early career data scientists. This information was then loaded into a non-relational mongo database for ease of retrieval. This information was brought back in as dataframes. These were analyzed to determine the quartiles for both salary and home price in Pennsylvania. The home prices were then brought down to 20% of their value to simulate a down payment and these were compared against annual salaries to determine how many years of work would be needed to earn this wealth (ignoring taxes and other expenses). These results indicate that if you earned the median income for a data scientist and purchases a median priced house in Pennsylvania it would take you almost 10 months to earn that down payment.
